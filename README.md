# Example Express.js Application

This repo holds an example Express.js application that uses FusionAuth as the identity provider. 
This application will use an OAuth Authorization Code Grant workflow to log a user in and 
get them access and refresh tokens.


This application was built by following the [Express.js Quickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-javascript-express-web/).

## Project Contents

The `docker-compose.yml` file and the `kickstart` directory are used to start and configure a local FusionAuth server.

The `/complete-application` directory contains a fully working version of the application.

## Project Dependencies
* Docker, for running FusionAuth
* Node 16 or later, for running the Changebank Express.js application

## Running FusionAuth

> Kickstart will only run if no API keys, users or tenants exist. If any exist, Kickstart will not run.
> You can remove docker containers and volumes by calling `docker compose down -v`

To run FusionAuth, just stand up the docker containers using `docker-compose`.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

This will start a PostgreSQL database, and Elastic service, and the FusionAuth server.

## Running the Example App
To run the application, first go into the project directory

```shell
cd complete-application
```

Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

Run Setup in `/complete-application/src/setup.ts`

```shell
npm run setup
```

Start the application

```shell
npm run dev
```
